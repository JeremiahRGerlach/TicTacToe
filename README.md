A game of Tic-Tac-Toe that allows 3 different ways of playing. First, the user can play against an "easy AI". This AI plays in a random open spot on the board. Next, the user can play against the "hard AI". This AI will check each row, column, and diagonal to see if it can win, or block the player from winning. If it can't win or block, it will play in the middle if it is open. If none of those options are avaliable, it will play randomly. The last way of playing is with 2 people. This is like a basic game of Tic-Tac-Toe on paper. The newest feature allows the player to choose if they want to play first or second. X always plays first!
